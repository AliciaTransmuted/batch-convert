# batch-convert
Shell script to convert a source directory of media to a target directory, using ffmpeg, with detailed ongoing progress sent to the terminal, and optionally to a log file
- the shell script may be easily populated with directory names to allow copying media to a predefined directory structure, which will be duplicated on the target directory when run
- the log may also be sent to a dated log file in a log directory, if selected
- enter "./batch-convert -h" to see all options
